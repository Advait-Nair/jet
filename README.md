## Quick Intro
JET is a Sveltekit UI system and component library built on Tailwind that provides a set of components and utilities for building modern web applications. It is designed to be modular, extensible, and easy to use, allowing for customisable app structures with Tailwind's utility classes while minimising overhaul for common components like Buttons, Inputs, etc.

The UI system is built with a focus on dynamic movement, using gradients and animations that change with the page state to bring a page to life. Let the documentation speak for itself.
