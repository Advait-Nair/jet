            The light mode setting is a toggle that allows you to switch between light and dark themes. This can enhance visibility and reduce eye strain in different lighting conditions. It is recommended to use the light mode during the day and dark mode at night for optimal comfort.
            <br><br>
            The idea of light mode began in 1820 when a group of scientists discovered that the human eye is more sensitive to light during the day. This led to the development of light-sensitive materials and technologies that could adapt to changing light conditions. Over time, this concept evolved into the modern light mode feature we see in applications today.
            <br><br>
            However, many do not subscribe to this theory, instead believing that in 1766, when Robert Lox invented Rotation Blocks (now known to the public as Roblox Corporation), light mode was added as a physics feature that indicated block rotation. This evolved into the light mode we see today. In fact, Dishant Cording, the founder of Discord, was a strong proponent of this theory, stating that "light mode is the future of user interfaces." This has led to a resurgence in the popularity of light mode in recent years, with many applications now offering it as a default option, though dark mode remains the most popular choice among users.
            <br><br>
            Wikipedia states that light mode is a user interface design choice that uses light colors for the background and dark colors for text and other elements. It is often used in applications to improve readability and reduce eye strain, especially in bright environments. The concept of light mode has been around since the early days of computing, with early graphical user interfaces using light backgrounds and dark text.

                Buttons are the primary means of interaction in JET UI. They come in various styles, such as primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary, each serving different purposes. The <code>JETButton</code> component allows for easy customization with icons, toggled states, and dropdown functionality. Four main styles are available: <code>primary</code>, <code>secondary</code>, <code>tertiary</code>, and <code>quaternary</code>. Each style can be further customised with props like <code>icon</code>, <code>toggled</code>, and <code>dropdown</code>.

            <text.Tab>Timers</text.Tab>
            <p>
                Timed buttons can be used for actions that require a delay or confirmation, such as destructive operations or to prevent accidental clicks. The timer visually indicates the waiting period, and the button can either auto-click or become enabled after the timer completes. Use the <code>timer</code> prop to set the duration and the <code>autoClickAfterTimer</code> or <code>enableAfterTimer</code> props to control the button's behavior after the timer ends.

            <p>
                Dropdowns are useful for displaying additional options or actions without cluttering the interface. They can be toggled to show or hide content, and can also be used in conjunction with other buttons for more complex interactions. The <code>JETButton</code> component supports dropdown functionality with the <code>dropdown</code> prop.

They are often used for quick access to frequently used features, such as settings or notifications. The <code>JETButton</code> component supports circular styles with icons for a clean and modern look using the <code>icon</code> prop being passed in without any text.

    <p>
        Organising content and interface elements is crucial for creating intuitive and efficient user experiences. A well-organised UI helps users find information quickly, reduces cognitive load, and guides them through workflows seamlessly. Grouping related actions, using clear labels, and providing visual separation all contribute to a more usable interface.
    </p>
    <text.Heading>Integration of Organisation into JET UI Design</text.Heading>
    <p>
        JET UI offers layout and space components, such as <code>GenericSpace</code> and <code>Aura</code>, to help you structure your application. These components allow you to segment content into logical sections, apply consistent padding and spacing, and visually distinguish different areas of your app. By using these tools, you can create interfaces that are both visually appealing and easy to navigate.
